            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This project investigates whether batting average (hit frequency) contributes to offensive consistency in run production, challenging the conventional devaluation of the metric in modern baseball analytics. 
                To quantify consistency, I built a Markov chain model in R with a 25 by 25 transition probability matrix, simulating inning outcomes based on different [outs, runners on base] configurations using 2023 MLB play-by-play data from Retrosheet. 
                By running simulations for various players, we measured variance in runs produced and the probability of producing at least X runs, comparing high-batting-average contact hitters to low-average power hitters. 
                Results showed that hit frequency plays a crucial role in producing at least one or two runs, particularly in high-leverage situations, while home runs drive higher expected runs but with greater variance
